### Project 21 - The Plumes of Io
**Objective:** Use pygame to build a 2D, gravity-based simulation of Io’s Tvashtar volcanic
plume. Calibrate the plume dimensions using a NASA image. Use multiple
particle types in the plume, trace the particles’ flight paths and allow the
eruption to run automatically until stopped.
